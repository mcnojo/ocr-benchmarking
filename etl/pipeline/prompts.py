"""
Prompt registry for the tree-building LLM pipeline.

Each prompt has two variants:
- "upstream": verbatim from VectifyAI/PageIndex
  (https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex — pageindex/page_index.py, pageindex/utils.py).
  Tuned for large/cloud models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet/Opus, Gemini Pro).
- "local":   elaborated for small open models (Gemma 4 e4b, Qwen 2.5 7B, etc.).
  Adds explicit negative examples, stricter JSON envelopes, and structural
  guidance the small models need to stay on task.

When upstream and local are identical, both keys point to the same function —
keep them separate so future divergence stays explicit.

Usage:

    prompt = get_prompt("toc_detector_single_page", style, content=text)
